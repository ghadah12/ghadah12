With attributes like ID, Genetics, Age, Hormonal Changes, Medical Conditions,Medications and Treatments ,Nutritional Deficiencies , Stress, Poor Hair Care Habits, Environmental Factors , and Hair Loss, we'll preprocess the data, apply different mining techniques, compare results, and share our findings on a GitHub repository with Jupyter notebooks. The focus is on creating effective models for hair lossÂ prediction.\r\n",
