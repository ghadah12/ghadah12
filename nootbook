# 1- Goal:

Our project aims to use Python and data mining techniques on a hair loss prediction dataset. With attributes like ID, Genetics, Age, Hormonal Changes, Medical Conditions,Medications and Treatments ,Nutritional Deficiencies , Stress, Poor Hair Care Habits, Environmental Factors , and Hair Loss, we'll preprocess the data, apply different mining techniques, compare results, and share our findings on a GitHub repository with Jupyter notebooks. The focus is on creating effective models for hair lossÂ prediction.

# 2- Dataset:

The dataset source is Kaggle : <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitvkulkarni/hair-health>

# 3- General info about the dataset:

This dataset contains information about various factors that may contribute to baldness in individuals. Each row represents a unique individual, and the columns represent different factors related to genetics, hormonal changes, medical conditions, medications and treatments, nutritional deficiencies, stress levels, age, poor hair care habits, environmental factors, smoking habits, weight loss, and the presence or absence of baldness. 
We had 11 attributes and 1000 objects.
